Yippee :)

It was an amazing experience. I had just started my journey with startup culture and my first code went live (with test cases thanks @hariom) within few days. One of the amazing thing about wingify is that they don't compromise with the quality of code and therefore they have mutliple review sessions for each PR before making it live. I came to know about the git hooks here which is used to run linting before pushing the code into the repo. It seems to me little annoyed initially but trust me it should be mandatory and it is a nice way to know the syntax or semantic errors before flooding the repo with dirty code. Lot of time you can heard Yahooooooooo..... sound here and there in our office premises whenever Jenkins build pass (amazing idea). As a reward I got a git Coffee Mug thanks @ankit.
