# How many address modes present for microprocessor ? 

* **Direct Addressing Mode:-** Data is directly copied from the given address to the register.
ex: LDA 3000H (The content at the location 3000H is copied to the register A).

* **Indirect Addressing Mode:-** The data is transferred from the address pointed by the data in a register to other register.
ex: - MOV A, M (data is transferred from the memory location pointed by the regiser to the accumulator).

* **Immediate Addressing:-** An immediate is transferred directly to the register.
ex: MVI A, 30H (30H is copied into the register A)

* **Implicit/Implied Addressing:-** This mode doesn't require any operand. The data is specified by opcode itself.
ex: INC A

* **Register Addressing Mode:-** Data is copied from one register to another register.
ex: MOV B, A
