<h1>My First Code Live @wingify</h1>

<p>It is an amazing experice I just started my era with startup culture and my first code live (with test cases thanks @hariom) within few days. One of the amazing things about wingify is they don't compromise with the quality of code and therefore they have git hooks to run jshint before pushing the code into the repo.It seems to me little annoyed initially but trust me it should be mandatory and it is a nice way to know the syntax or semantic errors before flooding repo with dirty code. Lot of times you can heard Yahooooooooo..... sound here and there in our office when Jenkins build pass (amazing idea).As a reward I got a git Coffee Mug thanks @ankit.</p>

<p>&lt;img&gt;&lt;/img&gt;</p>

<p>So overall the experience is nice and I am learning here amazingly fast.</p> -->
